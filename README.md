# Microservice Project with gRPC and Protocol Buffers in Go

## Overview

This project demonstrates a microservice architecture using Go, gRPC, and Protocol Buffers. It showcases how to build scalable, efficient microservices that communicate using gRPC and serialize data with Protocol Buffers.

## Features

- **gRPC Communication**: High-performance RPC framework for service-to-service communication.
- **Protocol Buffers**: Efficient, language-neutral data serialization.
- **Scalable Design**: Modular microservice architecture for easy scaling.
- **Docker Support**: Containerization for consistent deployment.
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated build and deployment workflows.
